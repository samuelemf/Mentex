abstract = {The current trend of building web applications using microservice architectures is based on the domain-driven design concept. Among practitioners, domain-driven design is a widely accepted approach to building applications. Applying and extending the concepts and tasks of domain-driven design is challenging because it lacks a software development process description and classification within existing software development process approaches. For these reasons, this paper provides a brief overview of domain-driven design-based software development activities and their classification into a well-known software development process.},
